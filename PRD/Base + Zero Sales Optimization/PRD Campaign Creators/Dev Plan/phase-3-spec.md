# Phase 3: Base Infrastructure
**Date: 2025-08-22 | Time: 15:45**

## Background
We need a base class for all campaign creation types, similar to how BaseOptimization works for bid optimizations. This creates a consistent pattern for adding more campaign types in the future and ensures all campaign creators follow the same interface.

## Goal
Create the foundational base class that all campaign creation implementations will inherit from.

## Files to Develop

### 1. `business/campaign_creation/__init__.py` (NEW FILE)
**TODO:**
- [ ] Import base_campaign_creator
- [ ] Import testing_campaigns when available
- [ ] Define __all__ list
- [ ] Add version constant

### 2. `business/campaign_creation/base_campaign_creator.py` (NEW FILE)
**TODO:**
- [ ] Create BaseCampaignCreator abstract class
- [ ] Copy pattern from base_optimization.py
- [ ] Define abstract validate() method
- [ ] Define abstract clean() method
- [ ] Define abstract process() method
- [ ] Add run_campaign_creation() orchestration method
- [ ] Add get_statistics() method
- [ ] Add logger initialization
- [ ] Add helper methods like _find_column()

## Development Tests
- Can import BaseCampaignCreator
- Abstract methods are defined
- Cannot instantiate base class directly
- Logger initializes correctly
- Statistics dictionary initializes

## User Tests
- No visible changes
- Application still runs normally
- Zero Sales still works
- No errors in console

## What User Will See
**Working:**
- Everything continues to work as before

**Not Working Yet:**
- No campaign creation functionality
- Checkbox doesn't trigger any processing
- No new file types accepted
