# Portfolio Optimization System Logic - Dry and Simple
*Saturday Emergency Documentation - New Zealand Social Worker & Village Approved*

## **WHAT THE SYSTEM DOES**

The system takes messy Excel files and organizes them properly. It fixes two main problems:
1. Empty portfolios that need proper names and settings
2. Campaigns that have no portfolio home

---

## **THE SYSTEM PARTS**

### **SERVICE.PY - The Front Door**
**Job:** Talk to the website and coordinate everything

**Steps:**
1. Receive file and instructions from website
2. Call orchestrator to do the work  
3. Return finished file to website
4. Handle any errors that happen

**Why needed:** Keeps website simple - it doesn't need to know business details

---

### **ORCHESTRATOR.PY - The Coordinator** 
**Job:** Manage all the work and make sure it happens in right order

**Steps:**
1. Look at what problems need fixing
2. Find right strategies for each problem
3. Run each strategy on the file
4. Send all results to results manager
5. Return combined final file

**Why needed:** Someone must coordinate all the different fixes

---

### **CONTRACTS.PY - The Rules**
**Job:** Define what every strategy must be able to do

**Rules for all strategies:**
1. Must have a name
2. Must explain what they fix
3. Must check if they can work on a file
4. Must do the actual fixing work

**Why needed:** Ensures all strategies work the same way

---

### **STRATEGIES FOLDER - The Problem Solvers**
**Job:** Each file fixes one specific problem

**EMPTY_PORTFOLIOS.PY:**
1. Find portfolios with no campaigns
2. Give them numeric names (1, 2, 3...)
3. Set default budget and dates
4. Return updated file

**CAMPAIGNS_WITHOUT_PORTFOLIOS.PY:**
1. Find campaigns with no portfolio
2. Put them all in portfolio 1
3. Mark them as updated
4. Return updated file

**Future strategies:** Each new problem gets its own 50-line file

**Why needed:** Keeps fixes simple and focused

---

### **RESULTS_MANAGER.PY - The Combiner**
**Job:** Take all the separate fixes and put them together safely

**Steps:**
1. Start with original file
2. Apply first strategy changes
3. Apply second strategy changes
4. Make sure no conflicts
5. Create final Excel file

**Why needed:** Prevents strategies from overwriting each other's work

---

### **FACTORY.PY - The Finder**
**Job:** Automatically find and create strategies

**Steps:**
1. Look in strategies folder
2. Find all strategy files
3. Create list of available strategies
4. Give orchestrator the ones it needs

**Why needed:** System automatically knows about new strategies

---

## **HOW IT ALL WORKS**

### **Step 1:** User uploads file to website
### **Step 2:** Website calls service.py 
### **Step 3:** Service calls orchestrator
### **Step 4:** Orchestrator asks factory for needed strategies
### **Step 5:** Each strategy fixes its part of the problem
### **Step 6:** Results manager combines all fixes
### **Step 7:** Service returns final file to website
### **Step 8:** User downloads organized file

---

## **WHY THIS DESIGN IS GOOD**

### **Simple:**
- Each file has one clear job
- No file is bigger than 50-80 lines
- Easy to understand what each part does

### **Flexible:**
- Add new optimizations by creating one new file
- No need to change existing files
- System automatically finds new strategies

### **Reliable:**
- Small files have fewer bugs
- Clear separation prevents conflicts
- Easy to test each part separately

### **Maintainable:**
- When something breaks, easy to find which file
- Changes only affect one small area
- No duplicate logic to maintain

---

## **ADDING NEW OPTIMIZATIONS**

### **Old System:**
- Create 8 files in new folder
- Copy lots of existing logic
- Update multiple other files
- Risk breaking existing features
- Takes 2-3 days

### **New System:**
- Create 1 file in strategies folder (50 lines)
- Follow the contract rules
- System automatically finds it
- No risk to existing features  
- Takes 1 hour
