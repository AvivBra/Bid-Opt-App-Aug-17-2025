## Test Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (Invisible Background Operation)
- Launch Portfolio Optimizer app on localhost:8501
- Initialize headless Chromium browser (completely invisible - no windows appear on screen)
- Verify access to input file: `PRD/Portfilio Optimizer/Excel Examples/Input Bulk Example.xlsx`
- Verify access to expected output: `PRD/Portfilio Optimizer/Excel Examples/Empty Port Output Bulk Example.xlsx`

### Phase 2: User Flow Simulation (Automated & Invisible)
- Navigate to Portfolio Optimizer page (automated clicking - no visual browser)
- Select "Empty Portfolios" optimization checkbox (automated selection)
- Upload input file via file picker (programmatic upload - no file dialog appears)
- Click "Process Optimizations" button (automated clicking)
- Wait for processing completion (monitoring without UI)
- Download output file to temporary location (silent download - no download dialog)

### Phase 3: Output Validation (Background File Processing)
- Load actual output file with pandas (silent file access - no UI)
- Load expected output file with pandas (background processing)
- **Content Normalization Phase**:
  - Normalize missing values (replace 'nan' with empty string)
  - Standardize floating point precision artifacts (e.g., "3.7399999999999998" → "3.74")
  - Trim leading/trailing whitespace from all cell values
  - Normalize boolean representations (True/False/1/0 standardization)
  - Handle empty string vs null value differences
  - Standardize date format variations within cells
  - Remove invisible characters (tabs, zero-width spaces)
  - Normalize number formatting (with/without commas, decimal consistency)
  - Standardize currency symbol presence/absence
  - Convert scientific notation to decimal representation where applicable
  - Handle Unicode character encoding differences
  - Standardize case sensitivity for text comparisons (when appropriate)
- **Structural Validation Phase**:
  - Verify sheet order and naming consistency
  - Validate column positioning and exact naming
  - Check row and column count precision across sheets
  - Ensure data type consistency for corresponding cells
- **Comprehensive Cell Comparison Phase**:
  - Compare ALL sheets (Portfolios, Campaigns, Product Ad) cell-by-cell (100% comprehensive validation)
  - Apply content normalization rules during comparison
  - Flag cells that differ after all normalization attempts
  - Generate detailed mismatch reports with cell coordinates and content types
- Calculate match percentage across all sheets and identify discrepancies in any sheet

### Phase 4: Results Analysis
- **96% Confidence Pass**: Files match exactly, real user will get identical results
- **Environment Risk Warning**: Files differ, 4% chance of browser/download environment factors
- **Logic Failure**: Files differ significantly, backend implementation issue detected
- Generate detailed discrepancy report with row/column locations
- Execute automated issue resolution protocol

## Success Criteria

### Test Pass (100% Confidence - MANDATORY)
- **Perfect Match Required**: 100.00% of ALL cells across ALL sheets match exactly after comprehensive normalization - no discrepancies allowed
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Portfolios sheet (214×14), Campaigns sheet (~976×49), Product Ad sheet (~984×49) all must match perfectly
- **Structural Requirements**:
  - All expected sheets exist in actual output with correct order
  - All expected columns exist with correct names and positioning in each sheet
  - Row and column counts identical across all sheets
  - Data types consistent for corresponding cells across sheets
- **Content Validation Requirements**:
  - Cell values match after applying comprehensive normalization rules
  - Floating point precision differences normalized within acceptable tolerance (±0.01 for monetary values)
  - Whitespace trimming applied consistently to all text values
  - Boolean representations standardized (True/False, 1/0, yes/no handled consistently)
  - Date/time formats validated for consistency within each sheet
  - Number formatting normalized (commas, decimals, scientific notation)
  - Unicode characters preserved and compared correctly
  - Invisible characters removed before comparison
  - Empty string vs null values handled consistently
  - Currency symbols standardized where applicable
- **PRD Compliance**: Only 1 empty portfolio renamed from "Test" to "1" following exact 6-step logic
- **PRD Compliance**: All other portfolios remain completely untouched
- **PRD Compliance**: Camp Count shows actual campaign counts, not zeros
- **PRD Compliance**: Campaigns and Product Ad sheets remain unchanged from input (after normalization)

### Test Fail Scenarios
- Missing sheets or columns
- Cell value discrepancies > 0% after comprehensive normalization
- Incorrect empty portfolio logic implementation
- File corruption or download failure
- **Content-Specific Failures**:
  - Structural mismatches (sheet order, column positioning, row counts)
  - Data type inconsistencies between corresponding cells
  - Floating point precision errors exceeding normalization tolerance
  - Text encoding problems causing character corruption
  - Date/time format inconsistencies that cannot be normalized
  - Number formatting discrepancies (scientific notation, decimal places)
  - Boolean representation mismatches after standardization
  - Invisible character presence affecting cell comparison
  - Currency symbol inconsistencies in monetary values
  - ID/reference formatting differences (padding, case sensitivity)
  - Whitespace handling problems (leading/trailing/internal spaces)
  - Unicode character encoding differences causing display issues

## Cell Content Validation Methodology

### Normalization Rules Applied During Comparison
- **Floating Point Precision**: Numbers with precision artifacts (e.g., "3.7399999999999998") are normalized to clean format ("3.74")
- **Whitespace Handling**: Leading and trailing spaces removed from all cell values
- **Boolean Standardization**: All boolean representations converted to consistent format (True/False)
- **Null Value Handling**: Empty strings, "nan", null values normalized to empty string
- **Date Format Consistency**: Date values within cells validated for format consistency
- **Number Format Standards**: Commas in numbers, decimal consistency, scientific notation conversion
- **Unicode Preservation**: Character encoding differences handled while preserving meaning
- **Invisible Character Removal**: Tabs, zero-width spaces, and other invisible characters stripped
- **Currency Symbol Standardization**: Consistent currency representation where applicable
- **Case Sensitivity Rules**: Text comparisons use appropriate case handling for data type

### Validation Tolerance Levels
- **Monetary Values**: ±0.01 precision tolerance after normalization
- **Date Values**: Format variations acceptable if semantically identical
- **Boolean Values**: Any valid boolean representation accepted after standardization  
- **Text Values**: Case-insensitive comparison for non-critical fields
- **ID Values**: Exact match required after padding/formatting normalization
- **Percentage Values**: Format differences acceptable (0.5 vs 50% handled consistently)

### Edge Case Handling
- **Large Numbers**: Scientific notation vs decimal representation normalized
- **Phone Numbers**: Format variations handled (dashes, spaces, parentheses)
- **Zero Padding**: ID fields with different zero-padding levels normalized
- **Time Formats**: 24-hour vs 12-hour format differences handled
- **Special Characters**: Unicode normalization for accented characters
- **Line Breaks**: Internal line breaks within cells preserved during comparison
