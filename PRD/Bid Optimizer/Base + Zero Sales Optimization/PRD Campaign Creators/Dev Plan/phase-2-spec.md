# Phase 2: State Management
**Date: 2025-08-22 | Time: 15:45**

## Background
The checkbox from Phase 1 is visible but doesn't persist its state. We need to store the checkbox selection in session state so it persists during the user's session and can be accessed by other components for processing.

## Goal
Store and manage the "Create Testing Campaigns" checkbox state in the application's session management system.

## Files to Develop

### 1. `app/state/session_manager.py` (MODIFY)
**TODO:**
- [ ] Add 'testing_campaigns_selected' to initialize()
- [ ] Initialize as False by default
- [ ] Add to clear_session() method
- [ ] Keep existing Zero Sales state variables

### 2. `app/state/bid_state.py` (MODIFY)
**TODO:**
- [ ] Add get_campaign_selections() method
- [ ] Add set_campaign_selections() method
- [ ] Add has_campaign_creation() check method
- [ ] Update is_ready_for_processing() to check campaign states

### 3. `app/state/campaign_state.py` (NEW FILE)
**TODO:**
- [ ] Create CampaignState class
- [ ] Add init() method with campaign-specific states
- [ ] Add save_campaign_template() method
- [ ] Add get_campaign_template() method
- [ ] Add reset_campaign_state() method
- [ ] Add is_testing_campaigns_selected() method

## Development Tests
- Session state initializes with testing_campaigns_selected = False
- Checkbox selection updates session state
- State persists across component reruns
- Clear session resets campaign states
- No conflicts with existing Zero Sales states

## User Tests
- Check the "Create Testing Campaigns" checkbox
- Navigate to another section
- Return to see checkbox still checked
- Refresh page (state should clear)
- Check both checkboxes work independently

## What User Will See
**Working:**
- Checkbox selection persists during session
- Can select both Zero Sales and Testing Campaigns
- Clear/Reset button clears selections

**Not Working Yet:**
- File upload won't change based on selection (Phase 6)
- Process button won't recognize campaign selection (Phase 6)
- No actual processing happens (Phase 4)
